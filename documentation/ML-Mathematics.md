## [Normal Distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFX5NWojp0)
- Bell shaped curve
- Examples
  - Height measurements
- Mean - Average value
- Variance
- Standard deviation - Data spread arround mean value

## [Population Parameters - Normal Distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vikkiwjQqfU)
- Population Mean
- Population Standard Deviation - Divide by number of samples

## [Estimated Parameters - Normal Distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzZ6GpcfoQY)
- Relatively large population size
- Relatively small sample size - Estimate parameters
- More data samples - More confidence in accuracy of estimated parameters
- Estimated Mean - Sample Mean
- Estimated Standard Deviation - Sample Standard Deviation

## Estimated Standard Deviation
- Use Estimated Mean or Sample Mean
- Divide by ( number of samples - 1 )
- Divide by number of samples under estimates population Standard Deviation

## Exponential Distribution
- Population Rate 

## Gamma Distribution
- Population Shape 
- Population Rate 

## t-Test
- p-value
- Samples from different distributions - Small p-value - Less than 5%
  - Large p-value - Increase number of samples to get small p-value - Less than 5%
- Samples from same distributions - Large p-value - More than 5%
  - Small p-value - Increase number of samples to get large p-value - More than 5%

## [p-value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vemZtEM63GY)
- One sided v/s Two sided
- Sum of 3 values 
  - Probability of event
  - Probability of equally rare event 
  - Probability of more rare event

## Null Hypothesis
- No difference between two distribution
- Reject Null Hypothesis OR Fail to reject Null Hypothesis

## [Covariance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtaqvPAeEJY)
- Relationship between two variables
- NOT scale invariant
- Positive covariance, Negative covariance, No covariance

## [Correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ_z8KWkhXE)
- Relationship between two variables
- Scale invariant - -1 to +1
- +1 - Positive correlation
- -1 - Negative correlation 
- 0 - No correlation
- Applicable to straight lines

## [R Squared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AQKmw14mHM)
- Relationship between two variables
- Scale invariant - 0 to +1
- Applicable to NON straight lines also
- R Squared - 0.9 - Relationship between two variables explains 90% variation in data
