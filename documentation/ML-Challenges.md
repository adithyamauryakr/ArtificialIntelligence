# Machine Learning Challenges
- Data quality
- Reproducibility
- Data drift
- Concept drift
- Scale
- Multiple objectives

## Data Quality
- Garbage in and garbage out
- Data accuracy
- Data completeness
- Data consistency
- Data timeliness

## Reproducibility
- Randomness
- Set random seed value
- Same data with same random seed
- Use containers 
- Standardize library versions

## Multiple Objectives
- Data scientist - Minimize model loss
- Product manager - Reduce number of defective products
- Executive team - Maximize profit
- Balance these multiple different objectives
